        This is a copy of the [official NATS Helm Chart](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-operator/tree/master/helm/nats-operator).

    - title: Why it exists?
      body: |
        I'm publishing it here until the official chart has an official repo (PR pending). My CI system requires a helm chart
        to be installed from a repo, rather than directly from the filesystem.
